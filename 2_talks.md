### Invited Speaker 2: Frank Keller
Title: **Predicting Human Sentence Production across Modalities and Languages**\\
Joint work with Moreno I. Coco, Eunice G. Fernandes, and Manabu Arai

Abstract: Human cognition is a highly integrated system which synchronizes
processes and representations across modalities. Previous research on
the synchronization between attention and sentence production
demonstrated that similar scene descriptions correspond to similar
sequences of attended objects (scan patterns). In this work, we
investigate whether this finding generalizes from English to languages
with different word order. We test whether synchronicity holds not
just within a language but across languages and examine the relative
contribution of syntax and semantics. Three groups of participants
speaking English, Portuguese, or Japanese described objects situated
in a visual scene, while being eye-tracked. Across all participants,
pair-wise sentence similarity was computed using Universal Sentence
Encoder, which generates multilingual vector-based meaning
representations. Part-of-Speech (PoS) sequences were assigned to the
produced sentences and similarities between PoS sequences and scan
patterns were measured using Longest Common Subsequence. We found that
similar sentences are associated with similar scan patterns in all
three languages. Moreover, we demonstrated for the first time that
this relationship holds across languages (e.g., if a Japanese and a
Portuguese sentence are semantically similar, their associated scan
patterns are also similar). In contrast, we find that syntactic
similarity (i.e., PoS similarity) is predicted by scan patterns only
within the same scene and only between languages with similar word
order. This confirms that visual attention and language production are
synchronized across language and modalities and points to a grammar of
perception that is language-independent, goes beyond syntactic
realizations, and manifests as oculomotor responses such as
eye-movements.

Bio: Frank Keller is a professor in the School of Informatics at the
University of Edinburgh. He has also held visiting positions at MIT
and the University of Washington. His research area is natural
language processing, with a particular focus on language and vision
tasks, such as image description, visual grounding, video
summarization, and visual story telling. His second main research
interest is computational narrative, where he works on modeling key
narrative concepts such as characters, plot turning points, and
suspense. This involves understanding or generating long-form texts
such as movie scripts or books, which is challenging for LLMs.

Prof. Keller is part of the leadership team of the UKRI Centre for
Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing; he serves on the
editorial board of the Transactions of the ACL, and he is an ELLIS
fellow. In the past, he has held an ERC grant in the area of language
and vision.
