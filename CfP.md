<!---## Workshop Description
Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) 2022 is a one-day workshop held in conjunction with the conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). The goal of CMCL is providing a venue for computational research on cognitive theories of language processing, representation and acquisition. The 2022 workshop follows in the tradition of earlier meetings at ACL 2010, ACL 2011, NAACL-HLT 2012, ACL 2013, ACL 2014, NAACL 2015, EACL 2017, LSA 2018, NAACL 2019, EMNLP 2020 and NAACL 2021.

## Invited Speakers

We are pleased to announce the following invited speakers for the 2024 edition:

- Aida Nematzadeh} (DeepMind)
- Frank Keller (University of Edinburgh) 

## Scope and Topics

Topics of interest for the workshop include:

- Stochastic models of factors influencing a speaker’s production or comprehension decisions
- Models of semantic interpretation, including psychologically realistic notions of word and phrase meaning and composition
- Incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms and their psychological plausibility
- Models of speaker-specific linguistic adaptation and/or generalization
- Models of first and second language acquisition and bilingual language processing
- Behavioral tasks for better understanding neural models of linguistic representation
- Models and empirical analysis of the relationship between mechanistic psycholinguistic principles and pragmatics or semantics
- Models of lexical acquisition, including phonology, morphology, and semantics
- Psychologically motivated models of grammar induction
- Psychologically plausible models of lexical or conceptual representations
- Models of language disorders, such as aphasia, dyslexia, or dysgraphia
- Behavioral datasets or resources for modeling language processing or production in languages other than English
- Models of language comprehension difficulty
- Models of language learning and generalization
- Models of linguistic information propagation and language evolution in communities
- Cognitively-motivated models of discourse and dialogue
- Network science and language processing


## Workshop Submissions

We accept three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications. All submissions should be in PDF format: https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Workshop/CMCL.
To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted manuscripts should not include any identifying information about the authors. Submissions with associated preprints (e.g. arXiv) will be considered. Submissions must be formatted using ACL 2022 templates, available at: https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp.
We accept papers that have been committed to ACL 2022: they will have to be submitted through the workshop website by Mar 18, 2022. Notice that the authors will be asked to describe how they addressed the ACL reviewers' comments.

**REGULAR WORKSHOP PAPERS** can be either full (8 pages of content + references) or short papers (4 pages + references) reporting original and unpublished research that combines cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. *If a workshop paper has been submitted elsewhere, the authors have to declare it at submission time. Papers to be presented at CMCL 2022 must be withdrawn from other venues.*

**EXTENDED ABSTRACTS** (from 2 to 4 pages + references) describe preliminary work or results that have not been published before. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop, but will *not* be included in the workshop proceedings.

We will also accept **CROSS-SUBMISSIONS** (from 2 to 4 pages + references) for papers on related topics that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g. CogSci). These papers will be presented at the workshop, but will *not* be included in the proceedings. Interested authors are asked to add a note on the original venue in the submission.


### SHARED TASK ON EYE-TRACKING DATA PREDICTION

This year, we have prepared a shared task on multilingual eye-tracking data prediction. Full details have been included at the shared task website [here: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36415](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36415).

- Deadline for Submission of ACL-committed papers: March 18, 2022
- Notification of acceptance: March 26, 2022
- Camera-ready version due: April 10, 2022
