Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content to address reviewersâ€™ comments. Thus, long papers are allowed to use at most **9 pages** of text and short papers may use up to **5 pages** of text, plus unlimited space for ethical considerations sections, impact statement, acknowledgements, and references.


The [Call for Papers](https://cmclorg.github.io/CfP) is updated with these instructions as well.
