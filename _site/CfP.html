<p>CMCL 2025 will be co-located with the 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics <a href="https://2025.naacl.org/">NAACL 2025</a></p>

<h2 id="workshop-description">Workshop Description</h2>
<p>CMCL 2025 is a one-day workshop held in conjunction with NAACL 2025. CMCL invites papers on cognitive modeling, cognitively-inspired natural language processing, and, more broadly, the alignment of language models with human cognition/perception. The 2025 workshop follows in the tradition of earlier meetings at ACL 2010, ACL 2011, NAACL-HLT 2012, ACL 2013, ACL 2014, NAACL 2015, EACL 2017, LSA 2018, NAACL 2019, EMNLP 2020, NAACL 2021, ACL 2022, and ACL 2024.</p>
<h2 id="scope-and-topics">Scope and Topics</h2>
<p>The research interests/questions include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analysis of computational models that process language data (e.g., neural language models, parsers)  to give insights into fundamental linguistic questions, e.g., on human language processing/acquisition.</li>
  <li>Analysis of human language data to give insights into fundamental linguistic questions, e.g., on human language processing/acquisition.</li>
  <li>Comparing/aligning computational models (e.g., neural language models, parsers) with human language data to understand/reverse-engineer what and how humans compute during language comprehension/production/acquisition and how/why.</li>
  <li>What can the cogsci/linguistics and NLP fields contribute to each other?</li>
  <li>Emergent communication/language: What are the sufficient conditions for the emergence of human-like communication/language?</li>
</ul>

<p>A more comprehensive description of the workshop scope is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Models of lexical acquisition, including phonology, morphology, and semantics.</li>
  <li>Models of semantic interpretation, including psychologically realistic notions of word and phrase meaning and composition.</li>
  <li>Models of incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms and their psychological plausibility.
Psychologically plausible models of discourse and dialogue.</li>
  <li>Models of speaker-specific linguistic adaptation and/or generalization.</li>
  <li>Models of first and second language acquisition and bilingual language processing.</li>
  <li>Models of language disorders, such as aphasia, dyslexia, or dysgraphia.</li>
  <li>Datasets or resources for modeling language processing or production in languages other than English.</li>
  <li>Models of language learning and generalization.</li>
  <li>Models of linguistic information propagation and language evolution in communities.</li>
  <li>Analyzing computational models that process language data (e.g., neural language models, parsers) from the above perspectives.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="invited-speakers">Invited Speakers</h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce the following invited speakers for the 2025 edition:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tessa Verhoef</strong> (Assistant Professor at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science)</li>
  <li><strong>John T. Hale</strong> (Full Professor at Johns Hopkins University).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important-dates">Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>February 16, 2025: Paper submission/commitment deadline</li>
  <li>March 10, 2025: Notification of acceptance</li>
  <li>March 17, 2025: Camera-ready paper due</li>
  <li>May 3-4, 2025: Workshop dates (the exact date TBAto be announced soon)</li>
</ul>

<p>Deadlines are at 11:59 pm AOE. The timeline may change slightly. We are trying to set our CMCL deadline to be after the completion of the ARR December cycle. That is, the authors in the ARR December cycle will have options to resubmit/commit it to the upcoming ARR rounds OR make a new direct submission to CMCL (see Submission types and Cross-submission policy Sections).</p>

<h2 id="workshop-submissions">Workshop submissions</h2>
<p>CMCL accepts direct submissions through the OpenReview site: <a href="openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/CMCL">https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Workshop/CMCL</a></p>

<p>This year, we do not accept the commitment of ARR-reviewed papers.</p>
<h2 id="submission-types">Submission types</h2>
<p>We invite three types of submissions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Archival regular workshop submissions that present original research in either long (8 pages + references) or short (4 pages + references) paper format.</li>
  <li>Non-archival submissions of extended abstracts that present preliminary results (from 2 to 4 pages + references).</li>
  <li>Non-archival cross-submission of long/short papers that present relevant research submitted/published elsewhere (including ACL “Findings of…” papers).</li>
</ol>

<p>Other submission details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authors must indicate if the paper is archival or non-archival <strong>when submitting the paper</strong>. That is, authors are <strong>not allowed to decide/change the archival/non-archival mode after receiving the reviews/notification</strong>.</li>
  <li>Only regular workshop papers submitted via (1) will be included in the proceedings, but all types of papers will have a presentation opportunity in the workshop.</li>
  <li>Submissions must be formatted using the ACL style template (<a href="github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files">https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files</a>) and submitted via a PDF file.</li>
  <li>It is strongly recommended that the paper include a “Limitations” section (after the main parts and before the references), which is not counted in the part of the page limit.</li>
  <li>Final versions of accepted papers will be given <strong>one additional page</strong> of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.</li>
  <li>Non-archival papers will be reviewed in a separate process than archival papers (although the timeline is the same); specifically, non-archival papers (2,3) will be evaluated with more priority to broader factors, such as the fit of the topic with the workshop, the status of the paper (e.g., already accepted to elsewhere or not), and the entire diversity of the topic/community in the workshop, as well as the soundness of the paper.</li>
  <li>We adhere to the new ACL anonymity policy: https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Anonymity_Policy</li>
  <li>This year, we do not host a shared task.</li>
  <li><strong>This year, we do not receive the commitment of ARR-reviewed papers to simplify the logistics. Instead, authors should submit their work via direct submission (without past reviews).</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cross-submission-policy">Cross-submission policy</h2>

<p>For regular archival submission, CMCL will refuse papers that are under review or will be submitted to other conferences, including the ARR cycles. For non-archival submissions, we allow the submission of papers that have been or will be published elsewhere, but again, authors can not change the presentation mode to be archival after their submission.

### Workshop Description
CMCL 2024 is a one-day workshop held in conjunction with ACL 2024. CMCL invites papers on cognitive modeling, cognitively-inspired natural language processing, and, more broadly, the alignment of language models with human cognition/perception. The 2024 workshop follows in the tradition of earlier meetings at ACL 2010, ACL 2011, NAACL-HLT 2012, ACL 2013, ACL 2014, NAACL 2015, EACL 2017, LSA 2018, NAACL 2019, EMNLP 2020, NAACL 2021, and ACL 2022.

### Scope and Topics
The research interests/questions include, but are not limited to:
- Human-like language acquisition/learning: How is language acquisition of language models (LMs) (dis)similar to humans, and why?
- Contrasting/aligning NLP models with human behavior data: What do humans compute during language comprehension/production, and how/why?
- Linguistic probing of NLP models: How well do current language models understand/represent/generalize language behaviorally/internally?
- Linguistically-motivated data modeling/analysis: How can one quantify a particular aspect of language?
- Emergent communication/language: What are the sufficient conditions for the emergence of language?

A more formal description of the workshop scope is:
- Stochastic models of factors influencing a speaker's production or comprehension decisions.
- Models of semantic interpretation, including psychologically realistic notions of word and phrase meaning and composition.
- Incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms and their psychological plausibility.
- Models of speaker-specific linguistic adaptation and/or generalization.
- Models of first and second language acquisition and bilingual language processing.
- Behavioral tasks for better understanding neural models of linguistic representation.
- Models and empirical analysis of the relationship between mechanistic psycholinguistic principles and pragmatics or semantics.
- Models of lexical acquisition, including phonology, morphology, and semantics.
- Psychologically motivated models of grammar induction.
- Psychologically plausible models of lexical or conceptual representations.
- Models of language disorders, such as aphasia, dyslexia, or dysgraphia.
- Behavioral datasets or resources for modeling language processing or production in languages other than English.
- Models of language comprehension difficulty.
- Models of language learning and generalization.
- Models of linguistic information propagation and language evolution in communities.
- Cognitively-motivated models of discourse and dialogue.

<!-- ## Workshop Submissions

We accept three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications. All submissions should be in PDF format: https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2022/Workshop/CMCL.
To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted manuscripts should not include any identifying information about the authors. Submissions with associated preprints (e.g. arXiv) will be considered. Submissions must be formatted using ACL 2022 templates, available at: https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp.
We accept papers that have been committed to ACL 2022: they will have to be submitted through the workshop website by Mar 18, 2022. Notice that the authors will be asked to describe how they addressed the ACL reviewers' comments.

**REGULAR WORKSHOP PAPERS** can be either full (8 pages of content + references) or short papers (4 pages + references) reporting original and unpublished research that combines cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. *If a workshop paper has been submitted elsewhere, the authors have to declare it at submission time. Papers to be presented at CMCL 2022 must be withdrawn from other venues.*

**EXTENDED ABSTRACTS** (from 2 to 4 pages + references) describe preliminary work or results that have not been published before. Accepted abstracts will be presented at the workshop, but will *not* be included in the workshop proceedings.

We will also accept **CROSS-SUBMISSIONS** (from 2 to 4 pages + references) for papers on related topics that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g. CogSci). These papers will be presented at the workshop, but will *not* be included in the proceedings. Interested authors are asked to add a note on the original venue in the submission.


### SHARED TASK ON EYE-TRACKING DATA PREDICTION

This year, we have prepared a shared task on multilingual eye-tracking data prediction. Full details have been included at the shared task website [here: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36415](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/36415).

For more info on the shared task: [cmclsharedtask@gmail.com](mailto:cmclsharedtask@gmail.com)


## Important Dates
