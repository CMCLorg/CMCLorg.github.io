<b>Tatsuki Kuribayashi (MBZUAI, <a href="https://kuribayashi4.github.io/">kuribayashi4.github.io</a>)</b> is a postdoctoral researcher in the natural language processing (NLP) department at <a href="https://mbzuai.ac.ae/">MBZUAI</a> in the United Arab Emirates.
He received his Ph.D. from Tohoku University, Japan. His research interest is using modern NLP techniques to understand humans and languages, focusing on modeling human reading behavioral data with modern language models, exploring the factors accelerating linguistic generalization of language models, and analyzing NLP models from linguistic and/or neuro-symbolic perspectives.
His involved research has won the AACL-IJCNLP 2022 SRW Best Paper Award and the ACL 2023 SRW Best Paper Award.</p>

<b>Ece Takmaz (University of Amsterdam, <a href="ecekt.github.io/">https://ecekt.github.io</a>)</b> is a postdoctoral researcher in the NLP group in Utrecht. Previously, she was a PhD candidate at the University of Amsterdam, where she was part of the Dialogue Modelling Group. She has a background in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Her interests lie in multimodal NLP, in particular, the integration of vision and language in deep neural networks for tasks such as image captioning and visually grounded dialogue modelling. In addition, she works on incorporating cognitive signals such as eye-tracking data into multimodal models.</p>

<b>Byung-Doh Oh</b> (New York University, <a href="https://byungdoh.github.io/">byungdoh.github.io</a>) is a Faculty Fellow at the NYU Center for Data Science. He previously received his Ph.D. in Computational Linguistics from The Ohio State University. His research aims to advance our understanding of language processing in humans and machines by drawing on techniques from psycholinguistics and machine learning. He is particularly interested in developing computational models that capture the real-time processing behavior of human language users, and interpretability methods for studying the predictions and representations of neural networks.</p>
